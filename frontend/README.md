# Frontend

This is the frontend for the Note Keeping App.

## SvelteKit Tutorial

If you are new to SvelteKit, I highly recommend you read the [SvelteKit Tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial) to get a better understanding of how SvelteKit works.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Generate API

To generate the API, run the following command:

```bash
npx openapi-generator-cli generate
```

## Folder Structure

- `src/` - Contains the source code for the frontend
  - `lib/` - Contains code abstracted away from the rest of the frontend, such as:
    - `api/` - Autogenerated code for interacting with the backend API (DO NOT EDIT)
    - `components/` - Contains the UI components that will be reused throughout the frontend
    - `mappers/` - Contains the mappers used to map the DTOs from the backend to the models used by the frontend
    - `stores/` - Contains the stores used by the frontend to store data in a reactive manner, these are used by components to display data
    - `types/` - Contains the types used by the frontend, such as enums, DTOs, etc.
  - `routes/` - This is where the magic happens, this folder contains the pages that will be rendered by the frontend
    - These pages are sorted into folders based on the route they are rendered on
    - You can read more about this in the [SvelteKit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#routing-pages)
- `static/` - Contains the static files for the frontend, these will all be copied to the root of the webserver
- `tests/` - Contains the tests for the frontend
- `.env*` - Contains the environment variables for the frontend, these are used to configure the frontend
