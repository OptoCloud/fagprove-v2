# Apprenticeship Certification Exam

This is my Apprenticeship Certification Exam to become a [Certified IT-Developer](https://www.udir.no/lk20/fagkoder/iuv3103).

## Solution

The documentation for the solution is split into four parts:

### [Planning](./docs/planning.md)

The planning documentation contains the initial planning for the project, including the requirements, user stories, and wireframes.

### [User Guide](./docs/guide-user.md)

The user guide contains instructions on how to use the application, including screenshots and descriptions of the different features.

### [Developer Guide](./docs/guide-developer.md)

The developer guide contains instructions on how to set up the development environment, as well as information about the architecture and implementation of the application.

### Inline documentation

In addition to the documentation in this repository, the code itself will also have inline documentation in the form of comments and in some places MD files within the directories.
